# MIRSCAPE
> A Cytoscape Plugin to Annotate Biological Networks with microRNAs

### Description:
miRSscape is a Cytoscape plugin allowing mining on biological networks annotated with microRNAs. It makes use of the knowledge base miRoâ€™, which introduce a new layer of associations between genes and phenotypes based on miRNAs annotations. Given a network, previously loaded into Cytoscape, miRScape allows to identify relationships among genes, processes, functions and diseases at the miRNA level and annotate them as attributes of each network node. These annotated networks may be further analyzed by using mining features available as plug-ins on Cytoscape allowing to find for examples hubs, interesting motifs and so on.
